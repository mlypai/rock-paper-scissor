# rock-paper-scissor

Project from "The Odin Project" curriculum.

Using javascript to create a page for game "Rock-Paper-Scissor".
It had to be played on console, but i added very simple and basic UI, hopefully i'll revise it in future.

Basically, just type your choice and hope that Math.random() chose differently.
